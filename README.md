# terminal-lightweight-hangman

hi this is my hangman project, it is easily changeable. You can change a number of words or just the words in an array in the source code.
It's described in the source code.

# how do i use it?
just compile it

```
make
```
and run it using
```
./hangman
```

aand it's done

## how to change word list and number of words?
edit ```hangman.h``` and compile it again. it's the configuration file.


##### and yeah, it also works on windows
