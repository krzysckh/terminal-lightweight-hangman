# terminal-lightweight-hangman

hi this is my hangman project, it is easily changeable. You can change a number of words or just the words in an array in the source code.
It's described in the source code.

# how do i use it?
just compile it e.g. using g++

```
g++ hangman.cpp -o hangman
```
and run it using
```
./hangman
```

aand it's done

yeah, it also works on windows
